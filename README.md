# Ramu Kaka
Universal ecosystem around automation with voice assistants


## The Problem

Voice Assistants, as we know, are the future of automating a tonne of things for us. But the average Joe doesn’t use ‘em because they are too difficult to configure and train. Also, existing virtual assistants are too limited.


For example, Google Assistant doesn’t remind your work colleague about a blocker you face and that you need a meeting. Ramu Kaka will do that using Google Assistant and some Zapier magic.


## The Solution

Build the most open-source ecosystem around virtual assistants, which help humans focus on real work and human interactions.


And have some fun with it!

## Concept

Ramu Kaka is a concept. It’s not a product, and will never be.

## Disclaimer

We’re not trying to create another Google Assistant or Siri. This repository is going to be used to bring together bots like Google Assistant or Siri and integrate them with other bots across Zapier, IFTTT, etc.

## Why the name Ramu Kaka?

Ramu Kaka is a caricature from Bollywood.

Ramu Kaka is usually the eldest non-blood relative member of the family that looks after the family’s well-being.

He’ll cook food, groom your pets, greet your guests, remember their birthdays and also btw help in your work (Yea, Jarvis).



Ramu Kaka is an emotion.

## Meeting reminders

@channel pls keep Goog Cal open in chrome all the time or have a system to set recurring alarms, I see that sometimes ppl don’t realize when a mtg is there and others have to call to remind…not a good cycle to be in
